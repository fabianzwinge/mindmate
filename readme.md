# 💬 MindMate

**MindMate** is your personal AI companion that checks in with you every day and asks:

> *“Hi there! How are you feeling today? What have you been up to?”*

You can respond freely, and the integrated **sentiment analysis** automatically detects your mood.  
Based on your emotional state, MindMate generates **Spotify playlists** that reflect how you're feeling.
